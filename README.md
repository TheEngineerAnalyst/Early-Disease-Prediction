# Early-Disease-Prediction

These files present an unsupervised machine learning approach to early disease prediction, developed by Sanjal Desai, Yashna Meher, Mishil Trivedi, and myself (Rebecca Bubis).

The rising prevalence of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions poses a significant public health challenge. Late-stage diagnoses often result in higher treatment costs and poorer patient outcomes. Our goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to identify early warning signs in patient data, enabling healthcare professionals to intervene sooner.

Using symptom-based medical records from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we apply clustering methods to group patients exhibiting early-stage disease patterns. This approach allows us to uncover hidden structures within the data, potentially improving early detection and preventive care.

The project consists of two main files:

M1: A preliminary analysis and initial approach, exploring the data itself, dimensionality reduction approaches, and clustering algorithms.
M2: The final model and results, incorporating insights from M1 to achieve more robust results.

Additionally, we have included a file from a team member who investigated an alternative approach that ultimately proved unsuccessful, providing valuable insights into method selection and model development.
