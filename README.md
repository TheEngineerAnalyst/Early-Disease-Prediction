# Early-Disease-Prediction

These files present an unsupervised machine learning approach to early disease prediction, developed by Sanjal Desai, Yashna Meher, Mishil Trivedi, and myself (Rebecca Bubis).

The rising prevalence of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions poses a significant public health challenge. Late-stage diagnoses often result in higher treatment costs and poorer patient outcomes. Our goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to identify early warning signs in patient data, enabling healthcare professionals to intervene sooner.

Using symptom-based medical records from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we apply clustering methods to group patients exhibiting early-stage disease patterns. This approach allows us to uncover hidden structures within the data, potentially improving early detection and preventive care.
